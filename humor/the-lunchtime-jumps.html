    "text": "An Irishman, a Mexican, and a redneck were doing construction work on scaffolding on the 20th floor of a building. They were eating lunch and the Irishman said, &#34;Corned beef and cabbage! If I get corned beef and cabbage one more time for lunch, I&#39;m going to jump off this building.&#34;

The Mexican opened his lunch box and exclaimed, &#34;Burritos again! If I get burritos one more time, I&#39;m going to jump off, too.&#34;

The redneck opened his lunch and said, &#34;Bologna again. If I get a bologna sandwich one more time, I&#39;m jumping too.&#34;

Next day, the Irishman opens his lunch box, sees corned beef and cabbage and jumps to his death. The Mexican opens his lunch, sees a burrito and jumps too. The redneck opens his lunch, sees the bologna and jumps to his death also.

At the funeral, the Irishman&#39;s wife is weeping. She says, &#34;If I&#39;d known how really tired he was of corned beef and cabbage, I never would have given it to him again!&#34;

The Mexican&#39;s wife also weeps and says, &#34;I could have given him tacos or enchiladas! I didn&#39;t realize he hated burritos so much.&#34;

Everyone turned and stared at the redneck&#39;s wife. &#34;Hey, don&#39;t look at me,&#34; she said, &#34;he made his own lunch!&#34;",
