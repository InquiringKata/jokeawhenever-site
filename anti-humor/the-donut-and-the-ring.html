    "text": "There was once an unemployed donut named Bob. Luckily for him, a pirate ship sailed into the port that day. He went to the captain of the ship and said, &#34;Can I work on your ship?&#34;

The captain said, &#34;No.&#34;

The donut went home sad and depressed. The next day, he went back to the captain. &#34;Can I work on your ship?&#34;

&#34;No!&#34;

The donut again sulked all the way back home. Then he had a brilliant idea. He’d ask the captain again. The next day, he went back to the ship docked at the harbor. &#34;Captain, can I work on your ship?&#34;

&#34;No, and the next time you ask, I’ll throw you overboard.&#34;

The next day, the donut comes back. &#34;Can I work on your ship?&#34;

The captain says no and throws him overboard.

If you didn&#39;t like that joke, here is another one you might like.

There was a man named Jim, who was a train conductor. One day he decided he wanted to propose to his girlfriend. So he takes a break from work and rents a boat. During a romantic moment, Jim gets on one knee and proposes. &#34;Will you marry me?&#34; Just as his girlfriend is about to say yes, a giant fish jumps out of the water, startling him. Jim drops the ring into the ocean.

Later that night, they go to a fancy restaurant, disappointed about losing the expensive ring. Jim’s girlfriend opens a clam, and guess what was inside?
