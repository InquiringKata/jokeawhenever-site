    "text": "Sally, a contestant on &#39;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&#39;, had reached the final plateau. If she answered the next question correctly, she would win $1,000,000. If she answered incorrectly, she would leave with only the $25,000 milestone money. As she suspected, the Million Dollar Question was no pushover. It was: &#39;Which of the following species of birds does not build its own nest but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds? Is it: A) The condor, B) The buzzard, C) The cuckoo, or D) The vulture?&#39;

Sally was on the spot. She didn&#39;t know the answer. She had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Ask the Audience Lifeline. All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline. She hoped she wouldn&#39;t have to use it because her friend, Jeni, was a blonde.

But she had no alternative. She called Jeni and read the question and the choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly: &#39;That&#39;s easy. The answer is C: The cuckoo.&#39;

Sally had to make a fast decision. She considered employing a reverse strategy, but Jeni had sounded so confident. Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, &#39;C: The cuckoo.&#39;

&#39;Is that your final answer?&#39;
&#39;Yes.&#39;
&#39;That answer is... absolutely correct! You are now a millionaire!&#39;

Three days later, Sally hosted a party for her family and friends, including Jeni. &#39;Jeni, I just don&#39;t know how to thank you,&#39; said Sally. &#39;How did you happen to know the right answer?&#39;

&#39;Oh, come on,&#39; said Jeni. &#39;Everybody knows that cuckoos don&#39;t build nests. They live in clocks.&#39;",
