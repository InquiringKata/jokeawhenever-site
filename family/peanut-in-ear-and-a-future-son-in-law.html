    "text": "One evening, a man was at home watching TV and eating peanuts.
He&#39;d toss them in the air and then catch them with his mouth. In the middle of catching a peanut, his wife asked him a question, and as he turned to answer her, the peanut fell into his ear.
He tried and tried to dig the peanut out, but only succeeded in pushing it deeper into his ear. He called his wife for assistance, and after several hours of trying to remove the peanut, they became concerned and decided to go to the hospital.
As they were ready to go out the door, their daughter came home with her date. After being informed of their problem, their daughter&#39;s date said he could get the peanut out.
The young man told the father to sit down. The young man then pushed two fingers up the father&#39;s nose and told him to blow, really hard.
When the father blew, the peanut popped out. The mother and daughter jumped and yelled with happiness. The young man insisted that it was nothing, and the daughter brought the young man to the kitchen for something to eat.
Once he was gone, the mother turned to the father and said, &#34;That&#39;s wonderful! Isn&#39;t he smart? What do you think he&#39;s going to be when he grows up?&#34; The father replied, &#34;From the smell of his fingers, probably our son-in-law!&#34;",
