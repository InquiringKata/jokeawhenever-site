    "text": "The boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees about an urgent problem with one of the main computers. He dialed the employee&#39;s home phone number and was greeted with a child&#39;s whispered &#34;Hello?&#34; on the first ring.

Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a youngster, the boss asked, &#34;Is your Daddy home?&#34;
&#34;Yes,&#34; whispered the small voice. &#34;May I talk with him?&#34; the man asked. To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, &#34;No.&#34;

Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, &#34;Is your Mommy there?&#34; &#34;Yes&#34; came the answer. &#34;May I talk with her?&#34; Again, the small voice whispered, &#34;No.&#34;

Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left home alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who should be there watching over the child. &#34;Is there anyone there besides you?&#34;, the boss asked the child. &#34;Yes&#34;, whispered the child, &#34;A policeman.&#34;

Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee&#39;s home, the boss asked, &#34;May I speak with the policeman?&#34; &#34;No, he&#39;s busy.&#34;, whispered the child.  &#34;Busy doing what?&#34;, asked the boss.
&#34;Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman,&#34; came the whispered answer.

Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the ear piece on the phone, the boss asked, &#34;What is that noise?&#34;
&#34;A hello-copper,&#34; answered the whispering voice.
&#34;What is going on there?&#34; asked the boss, now alarmed. In an awed whispering voice the child answered, &#34;The search team just landed the hello-copper!&#34;

Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated, the boss asked, &#34;Why are they there?&#34; Still whispering, the young voice replied, along with a muffled giggle, &#34;They&#39;re looking for me!&#34; ",
