    "text": "Three sons left home, went out on their own, and prospered.

Getting back together, they discussed the gifts they were able to give their elderly mother.

The first said, &#34;I built a big house for our mother.&#34; The second said, &#34;I sent her a Mercedes with a driver.&#34; The third smiled and said, &#34;I&#39;ve got you both beat. You remember how mom enjoyed reading the Bible? And you know she can&#39;t see very well. So I sent her a remarkable parrot that recites the entire Bible. It took elders in the church 12 years to teach him. He&#39;s one of a kind. Mama just has to name the chapter and verse, and the parrot recites it.&#34;

Soon thereafter, mom sent out her letters of thanks:

&#34;Milton,&#34; she wrote one son, &#34;The house you built is so huge. I live in only one room, but I have to clean the whole house.&#34;

&#34;Gerald,&#34; she wrote to another, &#34;I am too old to travel. I stay most of the time at home, so I rarely use the Mercedes. And the driver is so rude!&#34;

&#34;Dearest Donald,&#34; she wrote to her third son, &#34;You have the good sense to know what your mother likes. The chicken was delicious.&#34; ",
