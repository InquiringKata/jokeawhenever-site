    "text": "Get over here! &#34;You know, I went fishing up on Warwoman this weekend and saw something I ain&#39;t never seen before in my life... I was just driving along mindin&#39; my own business... I guess I was doin&#39; about 40 at the time, and I caught a glimpse of something in the rear view mirror... Next thing I know, I looked up and there was a four-legged chicken passing me!&#34;

As everyone chuckled, someone asked, &#34;Are you serious?!&#34;

&#34;Yep,&#34; Ford replied. &#34;I thought my eyes was playin&#39; tricks on me, so I speeded up a bit to catch up with it, and sure enough, it was a four-legged chicken running 50 miles per hour!&#34;

This really got everyone to laughing because they knew it was a &#34;Tall Tale&#34;... As the laughter died down he continued.

&#34;Kind of made me mad &#39;cause he passed me, so I passed him back... Next thing I know, I&#39;m running about 55 and the little rascal passed me again! I wasn&#39;t going to stand for that so I just about caught up with him again and was just getting ready to pass when he veered off down this dirt road kickin&#39; up dust to beat the band! So I locked her down and got in behind him, but that was the last I seen of him... I followed the road on down a ways &#39;till I came up on this old farm house. There was an old man out there splitting some firewood, so I stopped and asked him if he had seen any four-legged chickens running around there.&#34;

The old man put down his axe and pulled a handkerchief from his overalls to wipe the sweat away as he began to speak, &#34;Yep... That&#39;s the way I raise &#39;em.&#34;

Ford laughed and asked, &#34;Now... what in the world ever gave you the idea to do something like that?&#34;

The farmer replied, &#34;Well, I like legs and my wife likes legs... My son likes legs and my daughter likes legs... So I decided to start raising four-legged chickens so we could all get a leg when we cooked one.&#34;

Ford replied, &#34;You know... That&#39;s one of the smartest things I&#39;ve ever heard of... How does it taste?&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know... I ain&#39;t never caught one...&#34;",
