The man gets up and goes to the door where a drunken stranger, standing in the pouring rain, is asking for a push. &#34;Not a chance,&#34; says the husband, &#34;it is 3:00 in the morning!&#34; He slams the door and returns to bed. &#34;Who was that?&#34; asks his wife.
&#34;Just some drunk guy asking for a push,&#34; he answers.
&#34;Did you help him?&#34; she asks.
&#34;No, I did not. It is 3:00 in the morning and it is pouring rain out there!&#34;
&#34;Well, you have a short memory,&#34; says his wife. &#34;Can&#39;t you remember about three months ago when we broke down, and those two guys helped us? I think you should help him, and you should be ashamed of yourself!&#34;

The man does as he is told, gets dressed, and goes out into the pounding rain.
He calls out into the dark, &#34;Hello, are you still there?&#34;
&#34;Yes,&#34; comes back the answer.
&#34;Do you still need a push?&#34; calls out the husband.
&#34;Yes, please!&#34; comes the reply from the dark.
&#34;Where are you?&#34; asks the husband.

&#34;Over here on the swing,&#34; replies the drunk.",
