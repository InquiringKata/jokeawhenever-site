&#34;We don&#39;t have any money for food,&#34; the poor man replied. &#34;We have to eat grass.&#34;

&#34;Well then, you can come with me to my house and I&#39;ll feed you,&#34; the lawyer said.

&#34;But sir, I have a wife and two children with me. They are over there, under that tree.&#34;

&#34;Bring them along,&#34; the lawyer replied. Turning to the other poor man he stated, &#34;You come with us, also.&#34;

The second man said, &#34;But sir, I also have a wife and six children with me!&#34;

&#34;Bring them all as well,&#34; the lawyer answered.

They all piled into the limousine. Once underway, one of the poor fellows turned to the lawyer and said, &#34;Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you.&#34;

The lawyer replied, &#34;Glad to do it. You&#39;ll really love my place; the grass is almost a foot high!&#34;",
