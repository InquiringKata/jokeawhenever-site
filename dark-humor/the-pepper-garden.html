I&#39;ve been very depressed lately because it looks like I won’t be able to plant my peppers this year. You know how much your mother loved planting peppers this time of year, but I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me.
Love, Dad

A few days later he received a letter from his son:

Dear Dad,
Don’t dig up that garden! That’s where I buried the bodies!
Love, Vinnie

At 4am the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area looking for the bodies. They apologized to the old man after not finding any and left. That same day the old man received another letter from his son.

Dear Dad,
Go ahead and plant your peppers now. That’s the best I could do under the circumstances.
Love you, Vinnie",
