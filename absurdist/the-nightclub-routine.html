The comedian comes out for his second act of the evening and says, &#34;A guy walks into a nightclub with a beautiful girl on his arm.&#34;

Just then, a guy in the audience says, &#34;I think I&#39;ve heard this before.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;Maybe you caught my first act.&#34;

The man says, &#34;Not likely.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;A guy walked into a nightclub with a beautiful girl on his arm, not ten minutes ago, who could have been your twin brother.&#34;

The man says, &#34;My twin brother&#39;s dead.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;What is this, a wake?&#34;

The man says, &#34;I don&#39;t have to stand for this,&#34; so he stands up and goes out the door.

The comedian says, &#34;Are you out there? I can hear you breathing.&#34;

The man says, &#34;I&#39;m holding my breath.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;I&#39;m holding your wife.&#34;

The man says, &#34;That&#39;s not my wife, that&#39;s my dead twin brother&#39;s wife. You can have her if you want her.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;No thanks.&#34;

Just then, a guy walks into a nightclub with a beautiful girl on his arm. The comedian says, &#34;Who&#39;s that beautiful girl I&#39;m seeing you with?&#34;

The man says, &#34;That&#39;s no beautiful girl; that&#39;s my wife.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;Is she from Italy?&#34;

The man says, &#34;No, she&#39;s just Hungary.&#34;

Just then, a guy walks into a nightclub with a tattoo of a beautiful girl on his arm, eating elbow macaroni. The comedian says, &#34;What do you call that?&#34;

The man says, &#34;An entrance.&#34;

Just then, a guy rides into a nightclub on a horse. He goes to the bar and says, &#34;Give me a beer and get my horse a jockey.&#34;

The bartender says, &#34;I think your horse has had enough.&#34;

The man says, &#34;Then make it a short one, and get that lady&#39;s lawyer some briefs.&#34;

The lady says, &#34;I can defend myself, your honor.&#34;

The lawyer says, &#34;I can defend her honor, your honor.&#34;

The judge says, &#34;On her or off her, make up your mind.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;Definitely on her, that&#39;s the best offer I&#39;ve had all night.&#34;

The lawyer says, &#34;Shouldn&#39;t we drop leaflets before we bomb?&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;I&#39;m bombing? Maybe it&#39;s my material.&#34;

A tailor in the audience says, &#34;It&#39;s not your material; it&#39;s your suit. I can fix it for you, but it&#39;ll cost an arm and a leg.&#34;

The comedian says, &#34;Mind if I just put it on the cuff?&#34;

The tailor says, &#34;I&#39;ll fix it for just the arm then, and what a beautiful arm it is.&#34;

The tailor fixes the suit, cuts off the comedian&#39;s arm, and leaves for a night on the town. The arm is so beautiful, he gives it to his girlfriend as a present and she wears it around her neck as a stole.
