The bartender pours the beer and says, &#34;That will be $3.40 please.&#34;

The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the man and the ostrich come in again, and the man says, &#34;I&#39;ll have a beer,&#34; and the ostrich says, &#34;I&#39;ll have the same.&#34; Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with the exact change.

This becomes a routine until, late one evening, the two enter again.

&#34;The usual?&#34; asks the bartender.

&#34;Well, it&#39;s close to last call, so I&#39;ll have a large scotch,&#34; says the man.

&#34;Same for me,&#34; says the ostrich.

&#34;That will be $7.20,&#34; says the bartender. Once again, the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the bar.

The bartender can&#39;t hold back his curiosity any longer. &#34;Excuse me sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?&#34; the bartender asks.

&#34;Well,&#34; says the man. &#34;Several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I just put my hand in my pocket, and the right amount of money will always be there.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s brilliant!&#34; says the bartender, &#34;Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you&#39;ll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s right! Whether it&#39;s a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,&#34; says the man.

The bartender asks, &#34;One other thing, sir, what&#39;s with the ostrich?&#34;

The man replies, &#34;My second wish was for a chick with long legs.&#34; ",
