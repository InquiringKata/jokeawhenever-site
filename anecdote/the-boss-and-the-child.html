    "text": "The boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees about an urgent problem with one of the main computers. He dialed the employee&#39;s home phone number and was greeted with a child&#39;s whispered, &#34;Hello?&#34;

Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a youngster, the boss asked, &#34;Is your Daddy home?&#34;

&#34;Yes&#34;, whispered the small voice.

&#34;May I talk with him?&#34; the man asked.

To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, &#34;No.&#34;

Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, &#34;Is your Mommy there?&#34;

&#34;Yes,&#34; came the answer.

&#34;May I talk with her?&#34;

Again the small voice whispered, &#34;No.&#34;

Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left home alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who should be there watching over the child. &#34;Is there any one there besides you?&#34; the boss asked the child.

&#34;Yes,&#34; whispered the child, &#34;A policeman.&#34;

Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee&#39;s home, the boss asked &#34;May I speak with the policeman?&#34;

&#34;No, he&#39;s busy,&#34; whispered the child.

&#34;Busy doing what?&#34; asked the boss.

&#34;Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman,&#34; came the whispered answer.

Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the ear piece on the phone the boss asked, &#34;What is that noise?&#34;

&#34;A hello-copper,&#34; answered the whispering voice.

&#34;What is going on there?&#34; asked the boss, now alarmed.

In an awed whispering voice the child answered, &#34;The searchy team just landed the hello-copper.&#34;

Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated, the boss then had to ask, &#34;Why are they there?&#34;

Still whispering, the young voice replied
... along with a muffled giggle ... ... &#34;They&#39;re looking for me!&#34;",
