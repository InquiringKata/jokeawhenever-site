In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. However, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the better of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box there were 3 empty beer cans and $1,974.25 in cash.

After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her guilt and she confessed, saying, &#34;I am so sorry. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked in the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the empty cans in the box?&#34;

Bill thought for a while and said, &#34;I guess that after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.&#34;

Hillary was shocked, but though to herself, &#34;I am very disappointed and saddened, but I guess after all those years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and I guess that 3 times is not that bad considering the number of years we&#39;ve been together...&#34;

They hugged and made their peace. A little while later, Hillary asked Bill, &#34;So why do you have all that money in the box?&#34;

Bill answered, &#34;Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash.&#34; ",
