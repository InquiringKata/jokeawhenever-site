    "text": "Dear Mom,

Our scout master told us all to write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad&#39;s mother and tell her he is OK. He can&#39;t write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn&#39;t been for the lightning.

Camp counselor Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire, so he probably didn&#39;t hear him. Did you know that if you put a gas can on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn&#39;t burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. Jenny is going to look weird until her hair grows back.

We will be home on Saturday if Counselor Webb gets the truck fixed. It wasn&#39;t his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that with a truck that old, you have to expect something to break down; that&#39;s probably why he can&#39;t get insurance on it. We think it&#39;s a neat truck. He doesn&#39;t care if we get it dirty, and if it&#39;s hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in the cab. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us.

Counselor Webb is a neat guy. Don&#39;t worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn&#39;t any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks.

This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Counselor Webb wouldn&#39;t let me, because I can&#39;t swim, and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Counselor Webb isn&#39;t crabby like some camp counselors. He didn&#39;t even get mad about the life jackets.

He has to spend a lot of time working on the truck, so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our first aid badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Counselor Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. He said he used to get sick that way with the food they ate in prison. I&#39;m so glad he broke out and became our camp counselor. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing time.

I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don&#39;t worry about anything. We are fine.

Love, Cole ",
