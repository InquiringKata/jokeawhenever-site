1        &#34;The great love that I have for you
2        is gone, and I find my dislike for you
3        grows every day.  When I see you,
4        I do not even like your face;
5        the one thing that I want to do is to
6        look at other girls.  I never wanted to
7        marry you.  Our last conversation
8        was very boring and has not
9        made me look forward to seeing you again.
10       You think only of yourself.
11       If we were married, I know that I would find
12       life very difficult, and I would have no
13       pleasure in living with you. I have a heart
14       to give, but it is not something that
15       I want to give to you.  No one is more
16       foolish and selfish than you, and you are not
17       able to care for me and help me.
18       I sincerely want you to understand that
19       I speak the truth. You will do me a favor
20       if you think this is the end. Do not try
21       to answer this.  Your letters are full of
22       things that do not interest me.  You have no
23       true love for me.  Good-bye! Believe me,
24       I do not care for you.  Please do not think that
25       I am still your boyfriend.&#34;

So bad!! However, the boy told the girl before to &#34;READ BETWEEN THE LINES&#34;, meaning-only to read 1.3.5.7.9.11.13 (Odd No.)
So..Please try reading it again! It&#39;s so smart &amp; sweet....:) ",
