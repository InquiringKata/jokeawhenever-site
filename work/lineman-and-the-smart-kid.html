    "text": "The telephone lineman had been out drinking the night
before, and the next day he went to work not feeling too good.
At the first pole that he had to work on, he climbed to the top
and as he took his pliers out to repair the wire he dropped it,
so he had to climb all the way down to retrieve it. As he got
to the bottom of the pole and was picking up his pliers, a
small boy was there and said to the lineman, &#34;My daddy is a
lineman too and he would have had two pair of pliers, so he
wouldn&#39;t have to climb down the pole after the pliers that you
dropped&#34;.

The lineman tried to ignore the boy and climbed back up the
pole very slowly. About this time he needed a hammer to
drive in a large nail, and as he was taking it out, it slipped
and fell to the ground and again he had to climb down the
pole to retrieve it. So he slowly climbed down the pole and
sure enough the little boy was there and said. &#34;My daddy is
a lineman and he would have carried two hammers so if he
had lost one he wouldn&#39;t have to climb down&#34;.

This irritated the lineman, but he ignored the boy and
climbed back up the pole to finish his work. He was no
sooner up the pole when he had to go to the bathroom, so
down he climbs from the pole and goes over to the brushes
to take a leak, as he was going he saw the little boy
watching him through the brushes.

He had it and says to the boy &#34;I&#39;ll bet your dad doesn&#39;t have
two of these, does he?&#34;

The boy replied, &#34;No, but his would make two of yours&#34;. ",
