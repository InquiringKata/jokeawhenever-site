RE: Christmas Party
DATE: December 1

I&#39;m happy to inform you that the company Christmas Party will take place on December 23, starting at noon in the banquet room at Luigi&#39;s Open Pit Barbecue. No-host bar, but plenty of eggnog! We&#39;ll have a small band playing traditional carols. Feel free to sing along, and don&#39;t be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus!

RE: Christmas Party

In no way was yesterday&#39;s memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees. We recognize that Chanukah is an important holiday which often coincides with Christmas, though unfortunately not this year.
However, from now on we&#39;re calling it our &#34;Holiday Party&#34;.

The same policy applies to employees who are celebrating Kwanzaa at this time. Happy now?

RE: Holiday Party

Regarding the note I received from a member of Alcoholics Anonymous requesting a non-drinking table, you didn&#39;t sign your name. I&#39;m happy to accommodate this request, but if I put a sign on a table that reads, &#34;AA Only&#34;, you wouldn&#39;t be anonymous anymore. How am I supposed to handle this? Somebody?

RE: Holiday Party

What a diverse company we are! I had no idea that December 20 begins the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating, drinking and sex during daylight hours. There goes the party! Seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees&#39; beliefs. Perhaps Luigi&#39;s can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party - the days are so short this time of year, or else package everything for take-home in little foil swans. Will that work?

Meanwhile, I&#39;ve arranged for members of Overeaters Anonymous to sit farthest from the dessert buffet and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms. Did I miss anything?

RE: Holiday Party

So December 22 marks the Winter Solstice. What do you expect me to do, a tap-dance on your heads? Fire regulations at Luigi&#39;s prohibit the burning of sage by our &#34;earth-based Goddess-worshiping&#34; employees, but we&#39;ll try to accommodate your shamanic drumming circle during the band&#39;s breaks. Okay???

RE: Holiday Party

People, people, nothing sinister was intended by having our CEO dress up like Santa Claus! Even if the anagram of &#34;Santa&#34; does happen to be &#34;Satan&#34;, there is no evil connotation to our own &#34;little man in a red suit&#34;. It&#39;s a tradition, folks, like sugar shock at Halloween or family feuds over the Thanksgiving turkey or broken hearts on Valentine&#39;s Day. Could we lighten up?

RE: Holiday Party

Vegetarians!?!?!?!? I&#39;ve had it with you people!!! We&#39;re going to keep this party at Luigi&#39;s Open Pit Barbecue whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table furtherest from the &#34;grill of death,&#34; as you so quaintly put it, and you&#39;ll get your #$%^&amp;*! salad bar, including hydroponic tomatoes. But you know, they have feelings, too. Tomatoes scream when you slice them. I&#39;ve heard them scream. I&#39;m hearing them scream right now!

RE: Pat Lewis and Holiday Party

I&#39;m sure I speak for all of us in wishing Pat Lewis a speedy recovery from his stress-related illness and I&#39;ll continue to forward your cards to him at the sanitarium. In the meantime, management has decided to cancel our Holiday Party and give everyone the afternoon of the 23rd off with full pay. ",
