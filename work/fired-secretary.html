    "text": "Today I fired my secretary today because... Yesterday was my 40th birthday and I wasn&#39;t feeling too good that morning.
I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say, &#34;Happy
Birthday&#34;,
As it turned out, she didn&#39;t even say good morning, let alone any &#34;Happy
Birthday&#34;. I thought, well, that&#39;s wives for you, the children will
remember. The children came in to breakfast and didn&#39;t say a word.
So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and despondent..

As I walked into my office, my secretary Janet said, &#34;Good morning, Boss,
&#34;Happy Birthday&#34;. And I felt a little better that someone had remembered.
I worked until noon, then Janet knocked on my door and said &#34;You know,
it&#39;s
such a beautiful day outside, and it&#39;s your birthday, let&#39;s go to lunch,
just you and me.&#34; I said, &#34;By George, that&#39;s the greatest thing I&#39;ve heard
all day. Let&#39;s go!&#34; We went to lunch.
We didn&#39;t go where we normally go; instead we went out to a private little
place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously.
On the way back to the office, she said, &#34;You know, it&#39;s such a beautiful
day. We don&#39;t need to go back to the office, do we?&#34;
I said, &#34;No, I guess
not.&#34;
She said, &#34;Let&#39;s go to my apartment.&#34;

After arriving at her apartment she said, &#34;Boss, if you don&#39;t mind, I
think
I&#39;ll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable&#34;
&#34;Sure!&#34; I excitedly replied.
She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying
a huge birthday cake

----- followed by my wife, children, and dozens of
our friends, all singing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34;.
And I just sat there ----
