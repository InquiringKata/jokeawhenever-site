Manager: Do you have any experience as a salesman?

Young man: Sure, back in my hometown I was a salesman!

The manager likes the young man and employs him. The young man&#39;s first day at work was hard, but he managed to master it. After closing time, the manager comes to him and asks him how many sales he&#39;d made on his first day at work.

Young man: One

Manager: Only one?! Our salespeople average 20 to 30 sales daily! What was the amount of the sale?

Young man: 101,237 dollars and 64 cents.

Manager: 101,237 dollars and 64 cents?! What did you sell?

Young man: First I sold a small fishing hook to the guy, but then I also sold him a medium-sized hook. Then I sold an even larger hook and finally I sold him a fishing rod. Then I asked him where he wanted to go fishing, and he replied &#39;down at the coast&#39;. So I told him that he&#39;d need a boat. So we went to the outdoor section where the boats are, and I sold him that twin-engine Chris Craft. He doubted whether his Honda Civic would be able to tow the boat, so I took him to the car floor and sold him a new 4x4 truck.

Manager: Are you trying to tell me that a man came up to you to buy a fishing hook and you sold him a boat and an off-road vehicle? 

Young man: Actually, no. He came here to buy a pack of tampons for his wife. I told him, &#39;Oh well, your weekend&#39;s shot, so you might as well go fishing!&#39; ",
