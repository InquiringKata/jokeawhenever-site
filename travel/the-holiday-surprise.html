The agent had had a good week and the dejected couple looking in the window gave him a rare feeling of generosity.
He called them into his shop and said, &#34;I know that on your pension you could never hope to have a holiday, so I am sending you off to a fabulous resort at my expense, and I won&#39;t take no for an answer.&#34;
He took them inside and asked his secretary to write two flight tickets and book a room in a five-star hotel. They, as can be expected, gladly accepted, and were on their way.
About a month later the little lady came in to his shop.
&#34;And how did you like your holiday?&#34; he asked eagerly.
&#34;The flight was exciting and the room was lovely,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;ve come to thank you. But, one thing puzzled me. Who was that old guy I had to share the room with?&#34; ",
