    "text": "There once was a proud Irishman named Pat, who went to heaven and saw St. Peter at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34; and Pat replied, &#34;My name is Pat, I&#39;m an Irishman, born on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, died on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, marching&#39; in the St. Patrick&#39;s Day parade.&#34;

St. Peter said to Pat: &#34;Yes, this is true! Here&#39;s a little green cloud for you to drive around heaven in and here is a harp that, when you push this button here, will play &#39;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.&#39; Enjoy it, Pat. Have a good time in heaven.&#34; Pat jumps on his little green cloud, punches the button, and heads out with a smile on his face and a song in his heart.

He&#39;s having a wonderful time in heaven, driving his little green cloud around. But on the third day, he&#39;s driving down Expressway H-1 with the harp playing full blast when, all of a sudden, a Jewish man in a pink and white two-tone cloud with tail fins roars past him. And in the back of this cloud is an organ which is playing all sorts of celestial music.

Pat makes a U-turn right in the middle of the Heaven Expressway and charges back to the Pearly Gates. He says, &#34;St. Peter, my name is Pat, I&#39;m a proud Irishman. I was born on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, died on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, marching&#39; in the St. Patrick&#39;s Day parade. I come up here to heaven and I get this tiny, insignificant little green cloud and this little harp that plays only one song, &#39;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.&#39; But, there&#39;s a Jew over there. He&#39;s got a big, beautiful pink and white two-tone cloud and a huge organ that plays all kinds of celestial music and I, Pat the Irishman, want to know why!&#34;

St. Peter stands up from his desk. He leans over and motions Pat the Irishman to come closer. Then he says: &#34;Pat, shush! He&#39;s the Boss&#39;s Son!&#34; ",
