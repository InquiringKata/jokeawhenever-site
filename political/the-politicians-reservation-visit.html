The politician had worked up to his finale, and the crowd was getting more and more excited. &#34;I promise better educational opportunities for Native Americans!&#34;

The crowd went wild, shouting, &#34;Hoya! Hoya!&#34;

The politician was a bit puzzled by the native word, but was encouraged by their enthusiasm. &#34;I promise gambling reforms to allow a Casino on the Reservation!&#34;

&#34;Hoya! Hoya!&#34; cried the crowd, stomping their feet.

&#34;I promise more social reforms and job opportunities for Native Americans!&#34;

The crowd reached a frenzied pitch, shouting, &#34;Hoya! Hoya! Hoya!&#34;

After the speech, the Politician was touring the reservation, and saw a tremendous herd of cattle. Since he was raised on a ranch, and knew a bit about cattle, he asked the Chief if he could get closer to take a look at the cattle.

&#34;Sure,&#34; the Chief said, &#34;but be careful not to step in the hoya.&#34; ",
