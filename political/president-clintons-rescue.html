The boys looked at each other and decided that the right thing to do was to jump in and save him. They jumped in and brought him to shore.
When he regained his composure, he thanked the boys and offered them anything they wanted.

The first boy thought about what it was that he would ask of the president and finally decided that he would like a presidential appointment to West Point. The second boy agreed that a presidential appointment would be nice, but he wanted to go to Annapolis. The third boy thought and thought and thought, and finally he arrived at his decision. &#34;Mr. President, I would like a burial with honors at Arlington National Cemetery.&#34; The president was taken aback and asked the boy why he would ask for such an unusual reward at his young age. The boy replied &#34;When my father finds out I saved your life, he is going to kill me!&#34;",
