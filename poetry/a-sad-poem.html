It fills his heart with emptiness,
Saddens his soul with a certain cold bitterness.
He sits in the corner of his room",
    "text": "It creeps in him, a sunken soul.
It&#39;s dark, it&#39;s cold, it feels like a black hole.
It fills his heart with emptiness,
Saddens his soul with a certain cold bitterness.
He sits in the corner of his room,
Lost, tired, mistreated, it happened all too soon,
The thoughts and memories flash back,
Some were sweet, some so bitter, but it all made him sad.

She was all there ever was to him,
But what&#39;s left, a cry in the wind,
What was it that was his sin?
That tortured soul, it suffers within.
To eat, to sleep, to breathe the air,
To speak, to see, to live, he couldn&#39;t care,
But to the darkness he would stare,
It brought about nothing as it was still and bare.

The seconds of the clock roll by,
It never turns back, as hard as he would try,
Something&#39;s in life it cannot be,
Like a purple sky or a yellow sea,
But the truth in it, he refuses to see,
It became to him, a never ending misery,
A victim to a love he had lost,
A torn down soul, that was the cost.

The meaning of life, it was no more,
Taken away so cruelly, not a chance had he to fight for,
He felt so helpless, nothing can ever be done,
For even just a touch of joy or a drop of sun,
It was too much to take, as he just sighed,
A blade he picked, his wrist was sliced,
He had lost his soul, his life and all there is,
And to be with his one true love, he had missed.

Many a tear a shed for him,
His pain and misery had ended, but only so it seemed. ",
