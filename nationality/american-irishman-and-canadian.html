    "text": "Three very good friends were driving around one day. One is an American, one is an Irishman, and the other is a Canadian.

The three were in a serious car accident, instantly killing all of them. They arrive at the Pearly Gates.

St. Peter, seeing these three, hangs his head in despair. It seems the Gates aren&#39;t working, there&#39;s a lineup a mile long, and the Boss is not happy with his performance of late. Now these three arrive. He decides to make them a deal:

&#34;Give me $500, and I&#39;ll send you back right now!&#34;

You don&#39;t have to tell the American twice -- he recognizes a deal when he sees it. Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out $500 and hands it to Peter. He&#39;s immediately sent back to Earth.

At the accident scene, the American starts to move around, scaring the wits out of those gathered around. He tells his story to the crowd and the press, who of course don&#39;t believe him.

&#34;If that&#39;s true,&#34; says one reporter, &#34;where are your friends?&#34;

&#34;Well, when I left, the Irishman was trying to talk him down to $300 and the Canadian was yelling, &#39;SHOULDN&#39;T THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THIS!?&#39;&#34; ",
