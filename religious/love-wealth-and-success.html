&#34;Is the man of the house home?&#34;, they asked. &#34;No&#34;, she said. &#34;He&#39;s out&#34;.

&#34;Then we cannot come in&#34;, they replied.

In the evening when her husband came home, she told him what had happened.. &#34;Go tell them I am home and invite them in.&#34;

The woman went out and invited the men in.

&#34;We don&#39;t go into a house together&#34;, they replied.

&#34;Why is that?&#34; she wanted to know.

One of the old men explained: &#34;His name is Wealth...he said pointing to one of his friends...and said pointing to another one, &#34;He is Success and I am Love&#34;...Then he added, &#34;Now go in and discuss with your husband which one of us you want in your home.&#34;

The woman went in and told her husband what was said...

Her husband was overjoyed... &#34;How nice&#34;, he said!!...&#34;Since that is the case, let us invite Wealth... Let him come and fill our home with wealth&#34;....

His wife disagreed...&#34;My dear, why don&#39;t we invite Success&#34;?.....

Their daughter-in-law was listening from the other corner of the house... She jumped in with her own suggestion: &#34;Would it not be better to invite Love...Our home will be filled with love&#34;...

&#34;Let us heed our daughter-in-law&#39;s advice&#34;, said the husband to his wife...&#34;Go out and invite Love to be our guest.&#34;

The woman went out and asked the 3 old men, &#34;Which one of you is Love? Please come in and be our guest.&#34;

Love got up and started walking toward the house...The other 2 also got up and followed him...

Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success: &#34;I only invited Love, why are you coming in?&#34;

The old men replied together: &#34;If you had invited Wealth or Success the other two of us would&#39;ve stayed out.. but since you invited Love, wherever he goes we go with him... Wherever there is Love there is also Wealth and Success!!!!!! ",
