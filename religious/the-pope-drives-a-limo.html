&#34;Driver, could you please pull over?&#34; said the Pope, &#34;I would like to drive.&#34; 

&#34;O.K. your holiness,&#34; the driver replied, &#34;whatever you say.&#34; 

So the driver pulled over, and the Pope starts to drive. He gets the hang of it before long and decides to put the pedal to the metal. The Pope is flying around Manhattan enjoying his sense of power! 

A few minutes later, a police officer sees the reckless driving and signals the limo to pull over. 

&#34;All right, let me see your license and regis....&#34; The cop&#39;s voice cuts out when he saw that he was addressing the Pope. 

&#34;Oh, well... um... um... I&#39;ll be right back.&#34; The officer returned to his car and radioed headquarters and talked to the chief.

&#34;Chief, I just pulled over a very important man. What should I do?&#34; 

&#34;Well, how important is he? Is he the Governor?&#34; he asked.

&#34;No, he&#39;s way more important than that.&#34; 

&#34;Is he a Congressman?&#34;

&#34;Nope... He&#39;s way, waaaay more important than a Congressman.&#34;

&#34;Surely he can&#39;t be more important than the president!&#34;

&#34;Well... Who did you pull over?&#34; the chief asked.

&#34;Well, chief, let me put it to you this way... His chauffeur is the POPE!&#34; ",
