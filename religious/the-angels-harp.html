    "text": "Two angels are cruising around heaven, bored, looking for something to do. Then one says, &#34;Hey -- I&#39;ve got an idea! Let&#39;s go down to Earth! I know a great disco we can check out!&#34;
 
Angel Two says, &#34;Well, I don&#39;t know -- we&#39;re not supposed to leave heaven without permission. And what would we do with our harps? You know we&#39;re supposed to have them with us at all times! And what if we&#39;re late for roll call? We&#39;ll be in trouble!&#34;
 
&#34;Oh, stop your babbling,&#34; said Angel One. &#34;We&#39;ll take our harps with us -- the mortals can&#39;t see them, or even recognize us, if we don&#39;t want them to. Roll call&#39;s not for another 6 hours. We&#39;ll have plenty of time to fly on down there, party a bit, and get back. Come on -- I know the perfect place to go. The owner&#39;s a friend of mine.&#34;
 
So, the two angels head on down to Earth, and arrive at the disco. They walk up to the door man, who recognizes the first angel and waves them on in. He tells his buddy, &#34;Come on -- I&#39;ll introduce you to Sam, the guy who owns this joint.&#34; They go over to a short, stocky guy and the first angel says, &#34;Sam, this is my buddy Harold. Harold, this is Sam.&#34;
 
Sam smiles slightly and nods, then beckons the two angels toward the bar. As they walk away, the first angel explains, &#34;Sam doesn&#39;t talk much -- everybody calls him Sam Clam.&#34;
 
The two angels drink and party and dance, and generally have a good old time. The time slips by unnoticed. Suddenly, Harold looks at the clock and gasps. &#34;Hey man! We&#39;ve gotta fly -- we&#39;ve only got 20 minutes until roll call!&#34;
 
The other angel says, &#34;Relax -- we&#39;ve got plenty of time. But you&#39;re right -- we&#39;d better get going.&#34; He starts going around, saying goodbye to everybody, with Harold trying desperately to hurry him up. &#34;Come on! Come on! We&#39;ll be late!&#34;
 
Finally he&#39;s ready to go, and they take off for heaven. &#34;See?&#34; he says, I told you -- plenty of time.&#34;
 
Just as they arrive at the Pearly Gates, Harold suddenly stops short, a panicked look on his face. &#34;Oh no!&#34; he gasps. &#34;We&#39;re gonna get caught! Oh man, we&#39;re busted! We&#39;re in trouble!&#34;
 
&#34;Why? Why?&#34; asks the first angel. &#34;We&#39;re almost there! We can make it!&#34;
 
&#34;No, it&#39;s not that,&#34; cries Harold. &#34;I left my harp in Sam Clam&#39;s disco!&#34; ",
