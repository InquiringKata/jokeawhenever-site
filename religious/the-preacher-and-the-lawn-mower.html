&#34;I just want enough money to go out and buy me a bike,&#34; said the little boy.

After a moment of consideration, the preacher asked, &#34;Will you take my bike in trade for it?&#34;

The little boy asked if he could try it out first, and after riding the bike around a little while said, &#34;Mister, you&#39;ve got yourself a deal.&#34;

The preacher took the mower and began to try to crank it. Pulling on the string a few times with no response from the mower, the preacher called the little boy over, &#34;I can&#39;t get this mower to start.&#34;

The little boy said, &#34;That&#39;s because you have to cuss at it to get it started.&#34;

The preacher said, &#34;I am a minister, and I cannot cuss. It has been so long since I have been saved that I do not even remember how to cuss.&#34;

The little boy looked at him happily and said, &#34;Just keep pullin&#39; on that string. It&#39;ll come back to ya&#39;!&#34;",
