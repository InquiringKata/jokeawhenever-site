If you do bother them in any way, you will be handcuffed to the ugliest person in Heaven for all eternity.&#34;

The first teen thought that this was rather funny and, in all her laughter, stepped back, almost falling over. &#34;QUACK!&#34; She had stepped on a duck and so she was handcuffed to the ugliest person in heaven. The other two teens walked around Heaven, constantly torturing their unlucky friend. As fate would have it, the second teen stepped on a duck also. She was handcuffed to the second ugliest person in Heaven.

The two girls sat moping at the fact that they were chained to these people for eternity. The next day they saw the third teen; she was handcuffed to the most gorgeous guy they had ever seen. She looked at them, realizing their questioning eyes, and said, &#34;He stepped on a duck.&#34; ",
