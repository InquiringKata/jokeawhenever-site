After the new pastor had been there a few weeks, a member of the congregation offered to take the new pastor fishing. The vocal objector reluctantly agreed to allow them to use his boat and to go along.

The trio got into the boat and motored out on the lake. When they got ready to fish, they realized that all their tackle had been left on the dock. One of the men commented that he guess they would just have to go back and get it.

The pastor said that wouldn&#39;t be necessary, and she got out of the boat and started walking across the water toward the dock. The old grouch said, &#34;See I told you we never should have hired that woman. She can&#39;t even swim.&#34;",
