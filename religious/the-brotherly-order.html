    "text": "The Brotherly Order of Silence Times were tough during the Middle Ages, and Fergus the Younger wanted to become a monk because he thought the life looked pretty good. So he went to the local monastery to join up.

There, he met with Brother Martin of the Brotherly Order of Silence, who explained that Fergus would have to take a vow of silence with a three-month probationary period. During this time, he could speak exactly one word at the end of each month before a gathering of Brother Martin and the other monks. &#34;When you speak your last word, on the last day of the third month, I and the brothers will determine if we can accept you as Brother Fergus into the Brotherly Order of Silence.&#34;

Fergus thought that didn&#39;t sound too bad and agreed. He began his probation at the Brotherly Order of Silence.

Fergus was diligent and didn&#39;t speak a word for the first month. When the end of the month came, Fergus went before Brother Martin and the monks to say his word, and he remembered he needed new buckles for his shoes. So he said, &#34;Buckles.&#34; The monks understood and arranged to get Fergus some new buckles.

The next month, Fergus grew into his commitment and didn&#39;t speak a word all month. At the end of the month, when he went to say his one word, he remembered he was about out of toothpaste, so he said, &#34;Toothpaste,&#34; before Brother Martin and the gathering of monks. The monks understood and arranged to get him some more toothpaste.

Fergus was looking forward to making it through this last month in the probationary period, and then he could enjoy the secure life in the Brotherly Order of Silence. Even though the first week a button popped off his tunic down around his nether parts, which was highly embarrassing, he did not speak a single word all month. It was the most difficult month yet, and he could not wait for it to end.

Finally, his final probationary review on the last day of the month arrived. Fergus came before Brother Martin, and Fergus spoke his last word. &#34;Button!&#34; he exclaimed.

The brothers drew amongst themselves to make their decision and spoke in hushed tones. Fergus grew certain of his acceptance when the group opened up and Brother Martin stepped forward.

He looked at Fergus and said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry my son, but the brothers and I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve got what it takes to be a dedicated monk in the Brotherly Order of Silence. I&#39;m afraid we have to let you go.&#34;

Fergus was crestfallen—his dreams were being destroyed! He protested, &#34;Why not? I did everything you wanted. I didn&#39;t speak but one word for each of the three months of the probation!&#34;

Brother Martin replied, &#34;That may be true... but all you ever do is complain.&#34;",
