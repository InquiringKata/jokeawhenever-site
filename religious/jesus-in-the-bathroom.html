-o- Where is Jesus Today?
A Sunday School teacher of preschoolers was concerned that his
students might be a little confused about Jesus Christ because of the
Christmas season emphasis on His birth. He wanted to make sure they
understood that the birth of Jesus occurred for real.

He asked his class, &#34;Where is Jesus today?&#34;

Steven raised his hand and said, &#34;He&#39;s in heaven.&#34;

Mary was called on and answered, &#34;He&#39;s in my heart.&#34;

Little Johnny, waving his hand furiously, blurted out, &#34;I know, I
know! He&#39;s in our bathroom!!!&#34;

The whole class got very quiet, looked at the teacher, and waited for
a response. The teacher was completely at a loss for a few very long seconds.

Finally, he gathered his wits and asked Little Johnny how he knew
this.

Little Johnny said, &#34;Well . . . every morning, my father gets up, 
bangs on the bathroom door, and yells, &#34;Good Lord, are you still in
there?!&#34; ",
