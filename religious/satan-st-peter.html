    "text": "On the outskirts of town, there was a huge nut tree by the cemetery fence. One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. 

&#34;One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,&#34; said one boy. The bucket was so full, several rolled out toward the fence. 

Cycling down the road by the cemetery was a third boy. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, &#34;One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.&#34; 

He knew what it was. &#34;Oh my,&#34; he shuddered, &#34;It&#39;s Satan and St. Peter dividing the souls at the cemetery.&#34; 

He cycled down the road as fast as he could and found an old man with a cane, hobbling along. &#34;Come here quick,&#34; said the boy, &#34;You won&#39;t believe what I heard. Satan and St. Peter are down at the cemetery dividing the souls.&#34; 

The man said, &#34;Shooo, you brat, can&#39;t you see I&#39;m finding it hard to walk as it is.&#34; But after several pleas, the man hobbled to the cemetery. Standing by the fence they heard, &#34;One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me...&#34; 

The old man whispered, &#34;Boy, you&#39;ve been telling the truth. Let&#39;s see if we can see the devil himself.&#34; Shivering with fear, they peered through the fence, yet they were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of Satan. 

At last they heard, &#34;One for you, one for me. And one last one for you. That&#39;s all. Now let&#39;s go get those nuts by the fence, and we&#39;ll be done.&#34; 

They say the old guy made it back to town five minutes before the boy. ",
