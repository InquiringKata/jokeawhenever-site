    "text": "When Bill Gates died, he went up to Heaven, where Saint Peter showed him to his house; a beautiful 20-room house, with grounds and a tennis court. Bill Gates was pleased, and spent many months enjoying the amenities of Heaven.

One day, he was enjoying one of Heaven&#39;s many fine parks, when he ran into a man dressed in a fine tailored suit.

&#34;That is a nice suit, my friend,&#34; said Gates. &#34;Where did you get it?&#34;

&#34;Actually,&#34; the man replied, &#34;I was given a hundred of these when I got here. I&#39;ve been treated really well. I got a mansion on a hill overlooking a beautiful hill, with a huge five-hundred acre estate, a golf course, and three Rolls Royces.&#34;

&#34;Were you a Pope, or a doctor healing the sick?&#34; asked Gates.

&#34;No,&#34; said his new friend, &#34;Actually, I was the captain of the Titanic.&#34;

Hearing this made Gates so angry that he immediately stalked off to find St. Peter.

Cornering Peter, he told him about the man he had just met, saying, &#34;How could you give me a paltry new house, while you&#39;re showering new cars, a mansion, and fine suits on the Captain of the Titanic? I invented the Windows operating system! Why does he deserve better??!!!!&#34;

&#34;Yes, but we use Windows,&#34; replied Peter, &#34;and the Titanic only crashed once.&#34; ",
