    "text": "Neither legal, nor logical... A young law student, having failed his law exam, goes up to his crusty old professor, who is renowned for his razor-sharp legal mind.

Student: &#34;Sir, do you really understand everything about this subject?&#34;

Professor: &#34;Actually, I probably do. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be a professor, would I?&#34;

Student: &#34;OK. So I&#39;d like to ask you a question. If you can give me the correct answer, I will accept my marks as it is. If you can&#39;t give me the correct answer, however, you&#39;ll have to give me an &#34;A&#34;.&#34;

Professor: &#34;Hmmmm, alright. So what&#39;s the question?&#34;

Student: &#34;What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? &#34;

The professor wracks his famous brain, but just can&#39;t crack the answer. Finally he gives up and changes the student&#39;s failing mark into an &#34;A&#34; as agreed, and the student goes away, very pleased.

The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can&#39;t get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer: &#34;What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? &#34;

To the professor&#39;s surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands.

&#34;All right&#34; says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.

&#34;It&#39;s quite easy, sir&#34; says the student &#34;You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30-year-old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22-year-old lover, which is logical, but not legal. And your wife&#39;s lover failed his exam but you&#39;ve just given him an &#34;A&#34;, which is neither legal, nor logical.&#34;",
