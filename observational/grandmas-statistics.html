    "text": "When my grandmother was 89 years old, she was having problems with her heart. My family went with her to the cardiologist, who told her that she had a serious heart condition that required surgery. However, the eminent physician warned that because of my grandmother&#39;s age, complications could arise. He stated that because of her age, during the operation my grandmother would have a 70% chance of having a heart attack, a 60% chance of having a stroke, and a 50% chance of dying on the operating room table.

My grandmother, shocked, quickly interrupted the doctor and said, &#34;Doctor, as long as you&#39;re talking about statistics, THERE&#39;S A 100% CHANCE OF YOU NOT OPERATING ON ME!&#34; With these words, my grandmother got up and left the doctor&#39;s office.

My grandmother might be stubborn, but she&#39;s not a fool. So the next day she went to another doctor, who also told her that she needed the surgery. He also stated that her age might cause a problem, BUT he was telling her in a way that was positive as opposed to the negative way of the previous day.

My grandmother then asked the doctor, &#34;If I were you&#39;re mother, what would you recommend?&#34;

The doctor walked up to her, smiled, put his arm around her, and said, &#34;Mom, let&#39;s have the operation!&#34;

She had that operation and came out fine! Her positive attitude (which is vital to her and everyone) added seven more wonderful, happy years to enjoy life and her family.

Two months ago, she celebrated her 96th birthday, and my grandmother is still going strong, due in large part to her positive attitude. ",
