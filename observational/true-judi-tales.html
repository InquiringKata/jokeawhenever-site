An update on last week&#39;s ski trip. *I* came out of it ok, but poor Spud (my 11 year old daughter) decided to see if she could have a better time flipping her snow tube and sliding down the mountain on her pretty face. So, she wound up with a couple of &#34;battle scars&#34; (she&#39;s fine, y&#39;all, no lasting damage), and the next morning she was ready to go do it all again.

Let&#39;s do some True Judi Tales, shall we?

Pam turns herself in for a Judi by telling me that several years ago she was watching the movie &#34;Oklahoma.&#34; She was taken by the outdoor scenery, the lush green fields, and amazing blue sky. She turned to her family and asked, &#34;What state is this supposedly set in?&#34;

Sarah was on the &#34;up&#34; escalator when she turned herself in for a Judi. She noticed the stairwell between the two escalators and said to her friend, &#34;That&#39;s weird. Where did they put the stairs that go *down*?&#34;

Leith had just seen the comedy &#34;Very Bad Things&#34; and was telling Judi about it. Leith told Judi she wouldn&#39;t like the movie. &#34;Why?&#34; Leith replied, &#34;It&#39;s a very black comedy.&#34; Judi&#39;s very indignant reply, &#34;What? Are you calling me a racist?&#34; (Ray&#39;s note: Gawd, can I relate to this . . . )

Karen says her 5-year-old daughter got back at Dad for his constant teaching the kids &#34;smart-ass&#34; comments. (Ray again: hmmmm . . . there something ELSE else Dads are supposed to teach their kids?) Lauren decided to sneak a sip of Dad&#39;s beer. He caught her, confiscated the bottle, and Lauren said, without missing a beat, &#34;I&#39;ve got a fake ID.&#34;

Peter&#39;s manufacturing company seems to hire a slew of Judis. A few years ago they were having a discussion that some of the employees couldn&#39;t read, but that it was difficult to identify these employees, since they didn&#39;t want to just walk up to &#39;em and ask, &#34;Do you need help reading?&#34; There was even a Judi in management who came up with the great idea of putting a memo on the company bulletin board inviting them to reading class.

Mike is married to Judi. He&#39;d bought a network card at the computer store and was anxious to get home and get started on networking their home computers. He got home, Judi got home a couple of minutes later, and Mike handed her the network card. &#34;Look what I got to network the computers!&#34; Judi said, &#34;That&#39;s great! Is it installed yet?&#34;

Jacquel was tickled that Judi finally got engaged. Judi was bouncing around excited no end that she was going to get married! She started ticking off a list, out loud, of the folks she needed to call and tell the good news too. She stopped in mid-list and said, &#34;Oh, wait, I have to tell Mark!&#34; Forgetting, of course, that Mark is the one who proposed to her.

MR sends this in, and I don&#39;t believe it for a second, but what the hell, it DID make me laugh: Seems Judi had a speech impediment. She was working at the department store. Her supervisor was named Weldon Taylor. She&#39;d received a large check and needed his approval to accept it. She picks up the intercom and says, &#34;Wel Done Tator to the BBQ grills . . . &#34;

Mitch tells me of the story about this lady who also worked in retail. A woman came in and plopped a VCR on the counter. She said it didn&#39;t work. The lady behind the counter said she&#39;d have to sent it off to be fixed. The customer said she didn&#39;t want it fixed. So they just stood there and looked at each other for a few moments. Finally, the lady behind the counter said, &#34;Look, I&#39;m divorced, lady, and I don&#39;t have to read minds any more. What is it you want me to do with this VCR.&#34; ",
