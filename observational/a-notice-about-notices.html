It has been noticed that the responses to the notices have been noticeably unnoticed. This notice is to remind you to notice the notices and respond to the notices because we do not want the notices to go unnoticed. - The Department of Notification Dear Dept. of Notification, This is just a notice to let you know that I noticed your notice about the notices and I am responding to your notice to let you know that it did not go unnoticed. I hope you are glad that I notified you about those notices. - The Receiver of Notices Notifier Dear Noticee, We here at the Department of Notification were delighted to notice that you finally noticed one of our notices. In the future, please notice all future notices or we will be forced to note that you are not noticing the future notices and we will send you another notice... sometime in the near future. You have been officially notified. - The Department of Notification (Future Home of Reports) Dear Dept. of Notification, This notice is to let you know that your Notice to the responded notice has been noticed. In the future, I will be sure to notice all future notices so you will not have to send another notice notifying us in the future about not noticing the future notices, figuratively speaking of course. But I notice that in the future you will be changing to the Future Home of Reports. This may cause some problems in the future with notifying you of the notices. Will future reports need to be reported or sent back notification that it had been noticed? And, should we then start reporting to you that that your notices had been noticed, report back that we noticed your report or notify you that your report had been noticed? In any case, in the future, Financing will need to be notified. We will need to requisition another file cabinet - R for reports since we will be getting reports instead of notices, which go in our N file cabinet. That is just a bunch more figures than necessary. But figuratively speaking then where do we file notices of reports or reports on the notices? Also, in the future, send a notice to report higher figures to Financing so that I can get some aspirin. I am sure to notice a headache in the future which hopefully won&#39;t interfere with me noticing the future notices. - The Receiver of Notices Notifier (Future Reporter of Reports to the Future Home of Reports) ",
