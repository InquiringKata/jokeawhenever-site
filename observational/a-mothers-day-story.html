    "text": "&#34;I can&#39;t believe that the whole family will be coming over for Mother&#39;s Day dinner,&#34; Sarah thought to herself, as she sat down on the overstuffed chair in the master bedroom. Her loving husband, Jack, had just walked in with their newborn son, Jeremy, in his arms.

While holding Jeremy, Jack whispered into Sarah&#39;s right ear, &#34;Did you enjoy breakfast in bed?&#34; Sarah giggled and smiled her girlish smile at him. Jack was so kind to bring her breakfast in bed; he brought her her favorite breakfast, Orange-whipped French Toast, crispy fried bacon, fresh fruit with yogurt, and French roast coffee with a splash of cream.

&#34;I&#39;m glad to hear that you enjoyed breakfast, but Jeremy&#39;s hungry. Sorry, hon. I know this is your day of rest, yet I don&#39;t have the goods, like you do,&#34; Jack said sheepishly.

Sarah laughed at her husband and stated, &#34;You silly man.&#34;

Jack gently laid Jeremy into his mother&#39;s arms. &#34;I&#39;ll let you two do your thing. I&#39;ve got a couple more things to do for the shindig this evening,&#34; Jack stated as he tenderly kissed Sarah.

Jack began to walk out of the room. &#34;Jack?&#34; Sarah asked with tears built up in her eyes.

He turned around only to see a sad Sarah. He immediately walked back to her. While Jack brushed the tears off her face, &#34;Sarah, what&#39;s wrong? Are you experiencing post-partum depression?&#34; Jack asked with concern.

&#34;No. Well I don&#39;t think so,&#34; Sarah said with hesitation. Jack put his right had on Sarah&#39;s arm -- Sarah looked into his eyes, and stated, &#34;Jack I&#39;m scared. What if I&#39;m not a good mum?&#34;

Jack looked at his loving wife, and smiled. &#34;Sarah, since the day I met you, I knew you&#39;d be a wonderful mother.&#34; Jack stated with confidence.

&#34;Sarah, listen to what I have to say,&#34; Jack stated, as he pulled the ottoman up to him so he could sit down. &#34;Do you remember what happened to me three years ago?&#34; Sarah gave Jack a puzzled look. &#34;A lot has happened to us in the past three years,&#34; Sarah commented.

&#34;Okay, let me narrow that down,&#34; Jack said, and they both laughed.

&#34;Three years ago, I just met you. We were dating for about two months, when my mom was killed in the car accident.&#34;

Sarah interrupted, &#34;Jack, I do remember that tragic day. What does that have to do with me being a mum?&#34;

&#34;Sweetheart, please let me finish,&#34; Jack said. &#34;I&#39;m sorry honey, please continue,&#34; Sarah said, as she placed Jeremy on the other side. She looked into Jack&#39;s eyes, as he proceeded on.

&#34;Sarah, it was and still is today the little things you do -- only a million of them. I know you&#39;re not my mother; yet, you have a way of making me feel very special, like mom did. You always find time to sit with me and listen to what I have to say. I don&#39;t have the total times you&#39;ve cried with me, laughed with me, giggled with me, planned with me, and shared my pain, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s at least a million times. During my worst crisis you always make it better,&#34; Jack said as he smiled at Sarah.

By now, tears streamed down Sarah&#39;s face. &#34;The most important thing my mom did was to love me unconditionally -- as you do. Both of you put your heart and soul into everything you do. I admire that. I know Sarah, you&#39;ll do just fine. You&#39;re a very special lady -- Jeremy is a lucky boy to have you and so am I,&#34; Jack stated as he hugged Sarah and Jeremy.

&#34;Happy Mother&#39;s Day! my love,&#34; Jack said passionately. ",
