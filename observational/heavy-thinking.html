I began to thin",
    "text": "It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.

I began to think alone - &#34;to relax,&#34; I told myself - but I knew it wasn&#39;t true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.

I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don&#39;t mix, but I couldn&#39;t stop myself.

I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, &#34;What is it exactly we are doing here?&#34;

Things weren&#39;t going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother&#39;s.

I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, &#34;Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don&#39;t stop thinking on the job, you&#39;ll have to find another job.&#34; This gave me a lot to think about.

I came home early after my conversation with the boss. &#34;Honey,&#34; I confessed, &#34;I&#39;ve been thinking...&#34; “But Honey, surely it&#39;s not that serious.”

“It is serious,” she said, lower lip a quiver. “You think as much as college professors, and college professors don&#39;t make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won&#39;t have any money!”

“That&#39;s a faulty syllogism,” I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I&#39;d had enough. “I&#39;m going to the library,” I snarled as I stomped out the door.

I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS station on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn&#39;t open. The library was closed.

To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.

As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. “Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?” it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker&#39;s Anonymous poster.

Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was &#34;Porky&#39;s.&#34; Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.

I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.",
