    "text": "&#39;Twas the night before Y2K, and all through the nation
We awaited &#34;The Bug&#34;, The Millennium sensation.
The chips were replaced in computers with care,
In hopes that ol&#39; Bugsy wouldn&#39;t stop there.

While some folks might think they were snug in their beds
Others had visions of dread in their heads.
And Ma with her PC, and I with my Mac
Had just logged on to the Web and kicked back with a snack.

When over the server, there arose such a clatter
I called Mr. Bill Gates to see what was the matter.
But he was away, so I flew like a flash
Off to my bank to withdraw all my cash.

When what with my wandering eyes should I see?
My good old Mac - it looked sick to me.
The hack of all hackers was looking so smug,
I knew that it must be the Y2K Bug!

His image downloaded in no time at all,
He whistled and shouted, &#34;Let all systems fall!&#34;
Go Intel! Go Gateway! Now HP! Big Blue!
Everything Compaq, and Pentium too!

All processors big, all processors small,
Crash away! Crash away! Crash away all!
All the controls that planes need for their lights
All microwaves, trains, and all traffic lights.

As I drew in my breath and was turning around,
Out through the modem, he came with a bound.
A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know a new feeling of dread.

He spoke not a word, But went straight to his work
He changed all the clocks, then turned with a jerk.
With a twitch of his nose, and a quick little wink,
All things electronic soon went on the blink.

He zoomed from my system, to the next folks online,
He caused such a disruption, could this be a sign?
Then I heard him exclaim, with a loud, hearty shout,
&#34;Happy Y2K to you all, this is a heckuva night!&#34; ",
