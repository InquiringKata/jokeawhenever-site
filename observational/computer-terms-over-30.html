    "text": "A POEM FOR THOSE OVER 30

 A computer was something on TV
 From a science fiction show of note
 A window was something you hated to clean
 And ram was the cousin of a goat.

 Meg was the name of my girlfriend
 And gig was a job for the nights
 Now they all mean different things
 And that really mega bytes.

 An application was for employment
 A program was a TV show
 A cursor used profanity
 A keyboard was a piano.

 Memory was something that you lost with age
 A CD was a bank account
 And if you had a 3-in. floppy
 You hoped nobody found out.

 Compress was something you did to the garbage
 Not something you did to a file
 And if you unzipped anything in public
 You&#39;d be in jail for a while.

 Log on was adding wood to the fire
 Hard drive was a long trip on the road
 A mouse pad was where a mouse lived
 And a backup happened to your commode.

 Cut you did with a pocket knife
 Paste you did with glue
 A web was a spider&#39;s home
 And a virus was the flu.

 I guess I&#39;ll stick to my pad and paper
 And the memory in my head
 I hear nobody&#39;s been killed in a computer crash But when it happens they wish they were dead.",
