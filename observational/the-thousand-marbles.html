A few weeks ago, I was shuffling toward the basement shack with a steaming cup of coffee in one hand and the morning paper in the other. What began as a typical Saturday morning, turned into one of those lessons that life seems to hand you from time to time. Let me tell you about it.

I turned the dial up into the phone portion of the band on my ham radio in order to listen to a Saturday morning swap net. Along the way, I came across an older sounding chap, with a tremendous signal and a golden voice. You know, the kind, he sounded like he should be in the broadcasting business. He was telling whoever he was talking with something about &#34;a thousand marbles.&#34;

I was intrigued and stopped to listen to what he had to say. &#34;Well, Tom, it sure sounds like you&#39;re busy with your job. I&#39;m sure they pay you well, but it&#39;s a shame you have to be away from home and your family so much. Hard to believe a young fellow should have to work sixty or seventy hours a week to make ends meet. Too bad you missed your daughter&#39;s dance recital.&#34;

He continued, &#34;Let me tell you something Tom, something that has helped me keep a good perspective on my own priorities.&#34; And that&#39;s when he began to explain his theory of &#34; a thousand marbles.&#34;

&#34;You see, I sat down one day and did a little arithmetic. The average person lives about seventy-five years. I know, some live more and some live less, but on average, folks live about seventy-five years.&#34;

&#34;Now then, I multiplied 75 times 52 and I came up with 3,900 which is the number of Saturdays that the average person has in their entire lifetime. Now stick with me Tom, I&#39;m getting to the important part.&#34;

&#34;It took me until I was fifty-five years old to think about all this in any detail&#34;, he went on, &#34;and by that time I had lived through over twenty-eight hundred Saturdays. I got to thinking that if I lived to be seventy-five, I only had about a thousand of them left to enjoy.&#34;

&#34;So I went to a toy store and bought every single marble they had. I ended up having to visit three toy stores to round-up 1,000 marbles. I took them home and put them inside of a large, clear plastic container right here in the shack next to my gear. Every Saturday since then, I have taken one marble out and thrown it away.&#34;

&#34;I found that by watching the marbles diminish, I focused more on the really important things in life. There is nothing like watching your time here on this earth run out to help get your priorities straight.&#34;

&#34;Now let me tell you one last thing before I sign-off with you and take my lovely wife out for breakfast. This morning, I took the very last marble out of the container. I figure if I make it until next Saturday then I have been given a little extra time. And the one thing we can all use is a little more time.&#34;

&#34;It was nice to meet you Tom, I hope you spend more time with your family, and I hope to meet you again.&#34;

You could have heard a pin drop on the radio when this fellow signed off. I guess he gave us all a lot to think about. I had planned to work on the antenna that morning, and then I was going to meet up with a few hams to work on the next club newsletter. Instead, I went upstairs and woke my wife up with a kiss.

&#34;C&#39;mon honey, I&#39;m taking you and the kids to breakfast.&#34;

&#34;What brought this on?&#34; she asked with a smile.

&#34;Oh, nothing special, it&#39;s just been a long time since we spent a Saturday together with the kids. Hey, can we stop at a toy store while we&#39;re out? I need to buy some marbles.&#34; ",
