    "text": "The Story of the Red Rubber Balls There is a small family with only a father and a son. The father is quite rich, as he is the CEO of his own company. One day, the son turns 16. His father comes up to him and says, &#34;Son, you&#39;re finally of legal age to drive, and you&#39;re going through high school with perfect grades. So for your birthday, I&#39;ll buy you anything you want.&#34;

The son thinks hard for a moment, then replies to his father, &#34;Dad, all I want for my birthday is one red rubber ball.&#34;

The father is a little taken aback by his son&#39;s answer but complies nonetheless.

A few years later, the son finally graduates from high school. His father comes up to his son at his graduation party and says in front of everyone, &#34;Son, you finally finished high school and are about to embark into college. I&#39;m so proud of you. So whatever you want, I&#39;ll buy it for you.&#34;

Again, the son thinks hard for a few moments, then replies, &#34;Dad, all I want is ten red rubber balls.&#34;

Everyone at the party is confused at this statement, but the father, being true to his word, complies and buys the red rubber balls.

A few years down the road, the son is about to settle down with the love of his life. The father comes up to the happy couple on their wedding day and explains to his son, &#34;Son, you have no idea how overjoyed I am that you&#39;re finally settling down to start a family. If there is anything at all that you need, I&#39;ll provide it for you—anything, even a house.&#34;

The son, now contemplating, thinks for a few moments and replies, &#34;Dad, all I want for you to do is to give me and my wife 1,000 red rubber balls.&#34;

The father and wife both give him a very puzzled look, but the father complies yet again.

One year later, the son has finally graduated from college. At the ceremony, his father comes up to him and says, &#34;Son, you&#39;ve finally graduated college and are about to take your first steps into the life of a real man. No words can describe how proud I am at this moment. If there is anything you need, anything at all that I can give to help you out as you start your life, please, let me know.&#34;

The son takes him up on this offer and replies, &#34;Dad, you&#39;ve always been there for me. All I ask of you is 100,000 red rubber balls.&#34;

The father is getting extremely curious at this point but decides to hold his tongue.

Ten years later, the son is lying on his deathbed, dying of terminal cancer. The father, in tears, walks up to his son&#39;s bedside and says, &#34;Son, this isn&#39;t right. No one should have to be put through all this pain. You were such an amazing child; I don&#39;t know why you had to be given this illness. If there is anything I can do to help ease the pain, please just let me know.&#34;

The son closes his eyes, deep in thought. He slowly turns his head to his father and says, &#34;Dad, you&#39;ve done so much for me already, but there is just one more thing I want you to do. I want 1,000,000 red rubber balls.&#34;

At this point, the father can&#39;t hold his tongue any longer. &#34;Alright son, I&#39;ll get you the balls, but first you must tell me, what do you need all these for?&#34;

The son looks at his dad and says, &#34;Dad, I need them for...&#34;

And the son dies.",
