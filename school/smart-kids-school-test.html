The teacher asked, &#34;Johnnie what is your problem?&#34; Johnnie answered, &#34;I&#39;m too smart for the first grade. My sister is in the third grade and I&#39;m smarter than she is! I think I should be in the third grade too!&#34; The teacher had had enough. She took Johnnie to the principal&#39;s office. While Johnnie waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told the teacher he would give the boy a test, and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first grade and behave. The teacher agreed. Johnnie was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. Principal: &#34;What is 3 x 3?&#34; Johnnie:&#34;9.&#34; Principal: &#34;What is 6 x 6?&#34; Johnnie: &#34;36.&#34; And so it went with every question the principal thought a third grader should know. The principal looked at the teacher and told her, &#34;I think Johnnie can go to the third grade, just as he thought.&#34; The teacher says to the principal, &#34;Let me ask him some questions, and I&#39;m sure you will see the reasons I am hesitant about Johnnie&#39;s advancement!&#34; The principal and Johnnie both agreed. The teacher asked, &#34;What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?&#34; Johnnie, after a moment, replied, &#34;Legs.&#34; Teacher: &#34;Ok, you got that right, but I know I&#39;ll get you. What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?&#34; The principal&#39;s eyes open really wide and before he could stop the answer, Johnnie replied, &#34;Pockets.&#34; Teacher: &#34;What does a dog do that a man steps into?&#34; Johnnie: &#34;Pants&#34; Teacher: &#34;What word starts with an &#39;F&#39; and ends in &#39;K&#39; that means a lot of excitement?&#34; Johnnie: &#34;Firetruck&#34; Little Johnnie had been studying, and he&#39;d not fall for any of her tricks... nothing would hold him back if he could help it! The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, &#34;Put Johnnie in the FIFTH grade. I missed the last four questions myself!&#34; ",
