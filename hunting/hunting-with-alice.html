    "text": "It was Saturday morning as Jake, an avid hunter, woke up ready to go bag the first deer of the season. He walked down to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and to his surprise, he found his wife, Alice, sitting there, fully dressed in camouflage.

Jake asked her, &#34;What are you up to?&#34;

Alice smiled. &#34;I&#39;m going hunting with you!&#34;

Jake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decided to take her along. Later, they arrived at the hunting site. Jake set his wife safely up in the tree stand and told her, &#34;If you see a deer, take careful aim and I&#39;ll come running back as soon as I hear the shot.&#34;

Jake walked away with a smile on his face, knowing that Alice couldn&#39;t bag an elephant, much less a deer. Not 10 minutes passed when he was startled as he heard an array of gunshots.

Quickly, Jake ran back. As Jake got closer to her stand, he heard Alice screaming: &#34;Get away from my deer!&#34;

Confused, Jake raced faster towards his screaming wife. And again he heard her yell: &#34;Get away from my deer!&#34; followed by another volley of gunfire!

Now within sight of where he had left his wife, Jake was surprised to see a cowboy, with his hands high in the air. The cowboy, obviously distraught, said, &#34;Okay, lady, okay!!!! You can have your deer!!! Just let me get my saddle off it!&#34; ",
